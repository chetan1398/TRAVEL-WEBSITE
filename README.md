# INFO 6150 - ASSIGNMENT 4 
The goal of this assignment is to learn about CSS positioning, Grid layout & Flexbox, and SCSS features like variables, mixins, inheritance, control statements, functions, operators etc.


-_variables.scss: Defines global variables for colors, fonts, and breakpoints, used across all components for consistency.

-_mixins.scss: Contains mixins for common patterns like media queries, flexbox containers, and hover effects, applied in various files for DRY code.

-inputs.scss: Likely utilizes variables for styling consistency and mixins for responsive design elements.

-_layouts.scss: Employs grid and flexbox for structuring layouts, potentially using variables for layout parameters and mixins for common layout patterns.

-honeymoonPackage.scss, nav.scss, buttons.scss, footer.scss, promotions.scss, home.scss: These component-specific files use a combination of variables for theming, mixins for reusable styles, flexbox for layout adjustments, and possibly inheritance and control statements for conditional styling and extending common styles.
